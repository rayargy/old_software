I frequently forage around local second-hand shops buying every floppy
disk I can find. Some of them I buy with the intention of backing up
the software on it to help preserve our computing history. Others I buy
so I can actually use them for file storage; after all, hardly anybody
uses them - or can even read them - any more, so the potential privacy
benefit appeals to me.

Recently, though, I found some unlabelled disks that, when I inserted
them into my computer, revealed source code for some old software. I was
unable to find a copyright or a license, so I am assuming it is okay
to upload these to the Internet. If I am dead wrong and you can prove
to me that I am not legally permitted to upload this code, feel free to
contact me and I will gladly remove it.
